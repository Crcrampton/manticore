<p>Welcome to the <strong>Alpha Playtest</strong> campaign for Project
Manticore. In this campaign, you'll be doing some simple tasks to experience the
user interface and to help me out with debugging and quality control. Usually,
this sound clip would give some introductory narrative and exposition, probably
with some neat sound effects or music. At the moment, events only have pass and
fail states. For this event, to pass, all players must select the "PASS" button
on their device. To fail, simply have one or more players select "FAIL". When
all players have selected a value, the host screen should update with your
results.</p>
